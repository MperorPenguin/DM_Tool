# TabletopPals — Legal Pack (2025-09-06)

This folder contains ready-to-use legal templates and policies for your **DocumentsTabletopPals** project.
They are written for a UK-based owner (you) and designed to minimise copyright risk while keeping
the app proprietary (all rights reserved).

**How to use**

1) Drop the entire `LEGAL/` folder into your repo at `DocumentsTabletopPals/LEGAL/`.
2) Open each file and fill the `[BRACKETS]` (email, company name, address, etc.).
3) Commit the folder. Optionally link to `LEGAL/TERMS.md` and `LEGAL/PRIVACY.md` from your app footer.
4) Keep `LEGAL/THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES/` updated when you add libraries, fonts, or images.
5) Record every asset you add in `LEGAL/ASSET-PROVENANCE.csv` (this spreadsheet is your "paper trail").
