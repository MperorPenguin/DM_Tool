# Privacy & Cookie Notice

**Effective date:** [DATE]  
**Controller:** [YOUR NAME / COMPANY], [ADDRESS], contact: [EMAIL]

We process personal data in accordance with the UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018.

## What we collect
- **Contact data** you send (e.g., via feedback forms).
- **Technical data** (IP address, browser) captured by our hosting or security tooling.
- **In‑app storage**: We store your campaign/character data locally in your browser (localStorage/IndexedDB). This remains on your device unless you export/share it.

## Why we process it
- To operate the Service, respond to messages, prevent abuse, and improve features.
- Legal bases: **legitimate interests** (running our Service) and **consent** (where required, e.g., non‑essential cookies).

## Cookies & local storage
We primarily use **essential** storage (e.g., localStorage) to keep app state. We do not currently use analytics or advertising cookies. If we add any **non‑essential** cookies, we will request consent before setting them and provide controls to withdraw consent. See `COOKIE-POLICY.md` for details.

## Data sharing
We may use vetted processors (e.g., form processing or hosting). See `PROCESSORS.md`. We never sell personal data.

## Retention
We keep server logs up to 12 months (unless needed for security). Form submissions are kept as long as needed to handle your request and for audit/legal requirements.

## Your rights
You can request access, correction, deletion, or restriction; and object to processing where applicable. Email [EMAIL]. You also have the right to complain to the ICO (ico.org.uk).

## Children
The Service is not directed at children under 13. If you are designing features for children, we apply the UK **Age‑Appropriate Design Code** standards (see ICO guidance).

## Changes
We will update this notice as needed and post a new effective date.
